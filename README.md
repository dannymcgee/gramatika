# Gramatika
A minimal toolkit for writing parsers with Rust

## Status
This crate is still pretty young, but starting to feel comfortable in its own skin! It probably wouldn't be wise to give it too much responsibility just yet, but it should be up to the task of handling many common or straightforward use cases. API is subject to change from minor version to minor version until we hit `1.0`, but I'm pretty happy with the general shape of things at this point, so I wouldn't expect any major breaking changes anytime soon.

## Motivation
Though powerful and useful in a lot of situations, I find parser generators to be kind of fiddly and onerous to work with for a variety of reasons. On the other hand, writing a parser by hand requires a ton of tedious boilerplate just to get off the ground.

This project is an attempt to find _my_ Goldilocks zone (your mileage may vary) between automagic grammar-based tools and staring into the terrifying abyss of a blank `lib.rs` file. Currently, it provides a _lexer_ generator that's dirt simple to use, some convenience macros, and some barebones parsing primitives inspired by [syn](https://crates.io/crates/syn) &mdash; just enough to give you a rolling start and get out of your way.

## Getting Started
A brief tutorial and API overview is available in the [crate-level documentation](https://docs.rs/gramatika/latest/gramatika/).

You can also explore two fully-working, non-trivial example projects in this repo:

* [`examples/lox`](/examples/lox) is parser for the [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) implemented with Gramatika's derive macros.

* [`examples/lox_manual_impl`](/examples/lox_manual_impl) is a parser that _manually_ implements Gramatika's traits by hand-writing all of the code that's normally generated by the derive macros.

  This is a great place to start if you're curious about the implementation details, or if you need to manually implement any of Gramatika's traits to cover a special use case.
